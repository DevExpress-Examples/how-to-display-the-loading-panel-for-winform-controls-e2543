# How to: display the loading panel for WinForm controls


<p>Our WinForms Suite has the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument10821">Splash Screen Manager</a> component that can be used to indicate that the application is busy. A regular approach that is commonly used is enabling the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.usewaitcursor(v=vs.110).aspx">Application.UserWaitCursor</a> option. The Splash Screen Manager allows you to show custom loading panels with your own design instead.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-display-the-loading-panel-for-winform-controls-e2543/11.2.5+/media/d0c84e0e-f8f0-11e6-80bf-00155d62480c.png"><br>To learn more about the capabilities provided by the component used in this example, refer to the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument10824">Wait Form</a> document in our online documentation.</p>
